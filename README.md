# Java Simulations Project

This repository contains a collection of simulations implemented in Core Java. Each simulation is designed to model and visualize complex systems or processes. The project currently includes the following simulations:

1. **Aquarium Simulation**: This simulation models the behavior of a virtual aquarium. It includes various species of fish and aquatic plants, each with their own unique behaviors and interactions.

2. **Container Terminal Simulation**: This simulation represents the operations of a container terminal. It includes the loading and unloading of containers from ships, the stacking of containers, and the transport of containers to and from the terminal.

3. **Rowing Race Simulation**: This simulation depicts a rowing race between multiple teams. It models the rowing mechanics, the effects of weather conditions, and the competitive strategies of the teams.

Each simulation is contained in its own package and can be run independently. They all demonstrate the power and flexibility of Core Java for creating complex, interactive simulations. Feel free to explore the code, run the simulations, and contribute to the project!
